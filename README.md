#Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Python. RNNs are a class of deep learning models designed for sequential data, commonly used in time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.


#Features
Implements RNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
Supports different architectures such as Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU.
Includes data preprocessing and sequence padding.
Evaluates model performance using loss curves and accuracy metrics.


#Installation
To run the RNN algorithm, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-lear
Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.

#Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook RNN.ipyn
Run the cells sequentially to execute the RNN algorithm.



#Example
Load a dataset (e.g., text sequences, stock prices, or sensor data).
Preprocess and normalize the data.
Define the RNN architecture (Simple RNN, LSTM, or GRU).
Train and evaluate the model using performance metrics.


#Results
The notebook includes performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, loss curves, and visualization of model predictions.


#Contributing
Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests. If you improve the algorithm, fix bugs, or add new features, please update the documentation accordingly.
